# Producer/Consumer Simulation
**You can watch a UseCase from this [link](https://youtu.be/gu4jymWB-yQ)**

![Start](https://github.com/alia7med/Producer-Consumer-Simulation/blob/main/sample.jpg)

## Description 
 An assembly line that produces different products consists of different processing machines Ms that are responsible for processing the product at different stages and queue Qs to handle product movement between different processing stages (see figure below). 
## Requirement 
  Develop a simulation program to simulate this production line as a queueing network.

 ## Installation Guidelines
  You can find a detailed description [here](https://github.com/alia7med/Producer-Consumer-Simulation/blob/main/producer_consumer.pdf).
